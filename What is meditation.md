 What are the benefits of meditation? Is the practice of meditation really necessary?

Meditation is the practice of the mind. There is an interconnection between objective and subjective worlds. Even in exact sciences - like in physics, there’s an understanding that objective reality and subjective reality interconnected. For example, the particle/wave duality of light. Therefore, when we try to improve ourselves there are to ways:
Improve in the external world. If you change something externally, there will be a corresponding change in your mind as well. 
Similarly, if you change something internally, there will be a change in the external world as well.
These two ways should be balanced.
Most of us make efforts to improve in the external world - we study, work, become professionals, try to achieve excellence in our life. This is well and good. But why not try to achieve excellence in our life by using the meditation practice from the other direction, i.e. from within? 
Meditation practice is a very direct approach to improve your life for the better by engaging the mind itself. By changing yourself from within. 
There’s a certain principle of the mind: “As you think, so you become”. Meditation is based on this principle. This is similar to the principle: “As you eat, so you become”. Our thoughts are the food for our minds. Whatever we perceive and internalize from the external world - this becomes part of our personality. If you watched a movie that really impressed you, are you still the same person? Or were you changed by this experience? However slight the change, it can change your life. So, we are constantly changing… Our personalities are shaped by our thinking. So, in meditation, we make use of this “law”. In meditation, we replace crude and narrow ideas, with subtle and expanded ones.
Meditation is the practice where the mind is focused on the idea of conciseness. Or more exactly, on the idea of infinite conciseness. This kind of conciseness sounds abstract, as it is not easy to experience such a kind of conciseness. Yogis that did experience it, describe the feeling as infinite flow conciseness/love/bliss, as the absolute reality of the piece. If you focus your mind on the idea of absolute love, the idea of bliss, these qualities become part of your personality. This ideation energizes and creates noticeable changes such that people around you take notice. 
How do we practically replace crude and narrow ideas with subtle and expanded ones? For this, we need a practical process to achieve concentration. We remove negative/dark thinking by filling in the mind with positive ideas. But as you attempt to work with the mind - the mind resists, it chaotically jumps from one object to the other. So, in order to succeed with the replacement of the ideation in the mind, we need to practice concentration. 
Therefore, a successful meditation should consist of at least two processes: 
Concentration, i.e. narrowing the attention of your mind only on one thought, one object.
Contemplation (self-reflection, deep consideration). When you try to grasp very deeply the idea on which you are concentrating.
What are the meditation benefits?
The concentration practice itself educates how to become a successful person
The effort to achieve one goal develops self-determination. Winner-like psychology. I will do something, and I will be successful.
The mind itself becomes a lot more calm. The clarity of the mind depends on the calmness. Better control of emotions. This allows utilizing abilities to the full potential.
Diminished anxiety, stress, fear. 
Improved intuition. Many times we have a feeling that there’s a correct answer inside our mind, but we can’t quite grasp it due to its restlessness. 
Improved health. Especially helps with psychological disorders by switching the state of mind from negative thoughts and emotions to positive. 
Do we need meditation in the present society?
Our environment changed a lot. Our instincts evolved when we lived in nature. They evolved to overcome the challenges of the physical survivor. However, now we face challenges of the mind. Our civilization, the present situation on the planet, puts a lot of pressure on the mind. The mind has to adjust to the changes. 
Event 20 years ago, the world was completely different. Nowadays, the challenge is that society is very materialistic. The attention of the individuals is directed toward the matter, material achievements, material objects.  If we will recall the principle: “As you think, so you become”... If the ideation is crude and narrow, what happens to the mind? The mind de-evolves i.e. goes backward in the evolution. 
So, for the mind in order to break through, the mind has to be consciously engaged in the higher ideation. Then, the mind will evolve. It will receive advantages positioned in its environment. 
In comparison to animals that are limited by their environment, humans are masters of their destiny. Why? The difference is in the advancement of the mind. So, if you work on advancing your mind, you achieve a more advantageous position in your environment. But, if you allow the mind to flow within the materialistic path, it will become more simplistic and dependent on the environment. So, in the present society, meditation becomes an absolute necessity. 
Summary.
Meditation is the practice of the mind.
It is based on the principle: “As you think, so you become”.
Meditation is the replacement of the crude and narrow ideas, with subtle and expanded ideas with the aim to expand the mind, catalyze its evolution.
There’s a close link between the objective world and the subjective world. So, by making a change in the mind, we also do change the external reality. 
There are numerous benefits for meditation like developed intuition and the ability to cope with stress.
